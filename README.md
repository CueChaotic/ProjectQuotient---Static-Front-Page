===== PROJECT QUOTIENT =====

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** A brief introduction ***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put simply, Project Quotient is an idea of mine for a website of a game developer. It's a core part
of my journey to learn and develop skills in Software Engineering. It is, at this point, intended to
be entirely theoretical and in no way represents a real company or commercial undertaking (even the
name is a placeholder).

BUT, that being said, who knows what the future holds?

*** Feature overview ***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This only contains the static webpages. However the the current fuller build has the following very
surface-level features built using Django:
> Landing page, with a brief introduction to the "company".
> New user registration
> User login and authentication (Username and Password)
> Forum where users may post new discussion topics are add commentary to existing topics.
> A non-functional store page Working links to all of the above

NOTE: All the imagery is AI-generated (including the logo), massive thanks to ChatGPT for all its
hard work in that respect, you made me proud.

ENJOY (what little there is).
